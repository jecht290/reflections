When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--Gives you more control of how your work is separated between the repositories.
--Maybe you messed something up on the remote that you don't want also messing up your local
--Maybe you just are trying something on the remote, that isn't important enough to bring to your local.
